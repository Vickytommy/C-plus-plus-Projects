#### Task

Key words of my thesis are messed up by some weird virus. As a programming student I will write an algorithm, which is as efficient as possible, to sort words alphabetically. I remembered from the lecture material that MSD-Radix-sort to be good choice in this kind of situations. 

#### Commands

R <t>       : Reads data from le <t> and adds words to the data structure

S           : Sorts the data structure.

X min | max : Prints shortest or longest word and length of the word

P           : Prints contents of the data structure.

E           : Empties the data structure.

Q           : Quits the program.
