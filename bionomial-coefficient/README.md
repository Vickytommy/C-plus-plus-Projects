##### Binomial-Coefficient.cpp
###### Author: Abu SHumon
 
This test is originally implemented in JavaScript, but I have implemented a C++ version of it as well. 
See makefile for compiler information.

####### TASK 1: IMPLEMENT: C - binomial coefficient
 
 * C(n,k) = n! / [ k! (n - k)! ] Where x! is the factorial of x
 * Use a recursive solution.
 
####### TASK 2: IMPLEMENT: Test functions
 * Write a set of as many tests as needs in order to validate binomial coefficient function.
